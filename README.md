# Classical-encryption

• Cryptography is the science or art of secret writing.

• The fundamental objective of cryptography is to enable two people (Alice and Bob) to communicate over an insecure channel in such a way that an opponent (Oscar) cannot understand what is being said.

• Plaintext : the information that Alice wants to send to Bob.

• Alice encrypts the plaintext, using a predetermined key, and send the resulting ciphertext to Bob over the public channel.

• Upon receiving the ciphertext – Oscar cannot determine what the plaintext was – But Bob knows the encryption key, can decrypt the ciphertext and get the plaintext.

*So i implemented affine , ceasar , playFair , XOR Cipher by python and the user will choose which Cryptography would he wants
